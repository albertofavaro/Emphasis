Developed with Mathematica 10.0.1.0

# About 
*Emphasis* is a Mathematica package for tensor algebra. It is primarily designed to solve problems in the geometrical optics of bi-anisotropic media. Nevertheless, the package is also useful in the context of gravity. For example, *Emphasis* includes functions to calculate the Bel(-Robinson) tensor and the Kummer tensor.

# Installation 
* In a Mathematica notebook, input `$UserBaseDirectory`.
* Within this directory, look for the folder `Applications`.
* Store the files that make up the package in a subfoder of `Applications` to be named `Emphasis`.      

# Getting Started 
* To load the package from a notebook, type `<<Emphasis``.
* The notebook `Examples_Emphasis.nb`, accompanying the package, describes useful examples. 

# Acknowledgements 
Many thanks to Friedrich W. Hehl (Cologne) and Yakov Itin (Jerusalem) for insightful discussions about the irreducible decompositions of tensors.

# Log 
* 06 Mar 2015: *Emphasis 1.0* .
* 05 Aug 2016: *Emphasis 1.1* . Added the subpackage `TensorDecompositions`. This provides functions for the irreducible and canonical decompositions of tensors under the general linear group.
